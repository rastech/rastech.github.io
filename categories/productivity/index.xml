      <title>Introduction to Meta</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have seen our website, you know what we promise; Meta will allow you to access any file in seconds, no matter where it’s stored. But what exactly is Meta?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re pleased to give you a first glance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;width:50%;position:relative;left:25%;&#34; src=&#34;https://meta.sc/images/blog/intro_inverted.png&#34; alt=&#34;Meta Cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meta is a one-of-a-kind web service that provides you with a single portal to all of your digital files, whether they’re stored in your Documents folder, Google Drive, Dropbox, or your email inbox. Plus, Meta automatically organizes all of your files for you so you can stay focused on what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of your files, one place to search&lt;br&gt;Did you forget if you saved that file on Google Drive, Dropbox, or in your Documents folder? No Problem! Meta links with your Google Drive, Dropbox, Evernote, and OneDrive accounts, as well as your computers, devices, and hard drives, so you can search for and access files on any of these platforms with Meta. Meta doesn’t store or move any of your files; it simply gives you better access to them. Say goodbye to opening multiple tabs and clicking in and out of different folders to get to a document. With Meta, you’ll be able to access all of your files from a single interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get organized without the hassle&lt;br&gt;We get it. You have hundreds (or thousands) of documents on your computer. You receive email attachments every day. Who could be expected to stay on top of all these files? With Meta’s SmartTagging technology, you won’t have to. Meta automatically tags all of your documents for you so you don’t have to take time out of your day to organize. The best part? Meta learns from your behavior and preferences so its SmartTag suggestions get better the more you use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access any file instantly&lt;br&gt;Meta’s lightning fast search will get you to any file you’re looking for right away, no matter where it’s stored. Even better, Meta allows you to open the file in your favorite applications. No more read-only previews, downloading duplicates, or converting Word Documents to Google Docs. Open files directly from Meta in the applications you’re familiar with so you can go straight from searching for a file to editing it. Plus, Meta ranks your search results so the file you’re looking for is always right at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search without the memorization&lt;br&gt;Don’t remember what you named a file? Or specific content from the file? We’ve got you covered! Meta’s powerful search uses not only keywords to search for files, but concepts as well. Never miss a file because you forgot to type an apostrophe (true story). And since Meta is the first service that manages all of your files (local, cloud, mobile - you name it!) you won’t even have to remember where to start your search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay focused&lt;br&gt;Don’t stop what you’re doing to organize. With Meta, the tagging process is seamlessly integrated into your workflow. A couple clicks each time you download, create, or receive a new file will keep you completely organized- and you’ll never have to open or close a window. With Meta, you’ll spend less time processing files and more time working with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Tips for Taming Your Inbox</title>
      <link>https://meta.sc/blog/inboxtaming/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you frightened of opening your inbox? Do you receive dozens of emails each day? Does the sight of your email buildup make you physically ill? Does your phone vibrate nonstop, taunting you with the amount of emails you’ll have to deal with later? If you answered yes to any of the above, these handy email tips are for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;width:50%;position:relative;left:25%;&#34; src=&#34;https://meta.sc/images/blog/inbox.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cluttered Inbox&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deal with emails right away&lt;br&gt;I know it’s hard. Sometimes an email requires a long response (or an unpleasant one!) But the best way to beat the buildup is to deal with emails as soon as you get them. The minute you start putting off dealing with emails, your inbox starts spiraling out of control. “Dealing with” doesn’t necessarily involve a response - it could mean deleting an email you no longer need, archiving an email you might need to reference later, or forwarding an email for someone else to deal with. Just as long as you get it out of your inbox.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule a block of time each day for email&lt;br&gt;Dealing with emails right away isn’t always feasible (especially if you receive tons of emails). If you whipped out your laptop or phone the second you received an email, you wouldn’t get anything else done. Instead, set aside a block (or two) of time each day for dealing with the emails you have accumulated since your last email session. This way, you’ll still tackle your inbox without having it take over your life. This is also a great way to boost your productivity - you’ll have uninterrupted blocks of time between email sessions to get things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>5 Easy Tricks to Boost Your Productivity</title>
      <link>https://meta.sc/blog/productivitytips/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 10:47:50 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here at Meta, we love being organized and productive! Sadly, this is easier said than done. But fear not! We’ve compiled some of our favorite tips and tricks to help you crush this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;fullsize&#34; src=&#34;https://meta.sc/images/blog/organized.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Organized Desktop&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Failing to plan is planning to fail.”&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As harsh as it sounds, our friend Alan Lakein was definitely onto something! It requires a little extra time and effort, but a little planning goes a long way! Spend 10-15 minutes each night planning the next day. Use your planner, the calendar on your phone, a sticky note, a sheet of paper, the back of your hand - whatever! Just make sure you write your schedule somewhere. You’ll never have to stop in the middle of the day and wonder what you should do next - you’ll already have laid everything out the night before!
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prioritize!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No matter how nicely you plan your day, things don’t always go according to plan. Something unexpected will come up or a project will take longer than you thought. Don’t despair! Every day, set one item on your schedule as the most important. If you do nothing else that day, you’ll feel better knowing you accomplished the most important task.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Take breaks&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Working at 100% for hours on end is unrealistic. Schedule frequent breaks throughout your day. They don’t have to be long - get up and stretch, grab a snack, take a quick walk - just something to give your mind and body a quick break. You’ll feel rejuvenated when it’s time to get back to business! &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-rule-of-52-and-17-its-random-but-it-ups-your-productivity&#34;&gt; This post &lt;/a&gt; from the Muse has an interesting theory on breaks.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to go off-the-grid&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trust me, I know it’s tempting to respond to a text or email right away. But dropping what you’re working on to respond immediately breaks up your workflow and squashes your productivity. Set aside a block (or two) of time each day for responding to emails. During the rest of the day, close your inbox and put your devices away.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Get your beauty sleep&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I know this is a hard one - it’s difficult to fit work, the gym, grocery shopping, dinner, etc. into a single day, let alone finish by a reasonable hour. But I cannot emphasize enough how important a good night’s sleep is! Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/18/scary-sleep-deprivation-effects_n_2807026.html&#34;&gt; this Huffington Post article &lt;/a&gt; if you’re not convinced! Try your best not to pack too many things into a single day. And once you finally get to bed, put away your phone and computer (and other devices) to make the most of your limited rest time.
        &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope these tricks work as well for you as they do for us! And feel free to share your favorite tips and tricks with us. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Can&#39;t Find Your Files? You&#39;re Not Alone!</title>
      <link>https://meta.sc/blog/notalone/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2015 10:35:23 -0400</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many times have you needed a document on your computer but couldn’t find it right away?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re very meticulous about filing your documents in folders, maybe you opened the Finder or Windows Explorer and navigated to the correct folder. If you haven’t accessed the document in awhile, perhaps you clicked into the wrong folder at first. Or searched through Dropbox before realizing it was on Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;fullsize&#34; src=&#34;https://meta.sc/images/blog/cluttered_desktop.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cluttered Desktop&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If filing documents isn’t quite your thing, perhaps you searched around for the file on your Desktop. Or used Spotlight to search for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you didn’t find it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to find your documents, but none of them are satisfactory. They are “good enough” in the sense that they usually get you to the document you’re looking for. But how long does it take? How long do you spend clicking in and out of different folders or trying different search terms?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s 2015, but we’re still using filing cabinet technology to organize files on our computers. To find a document, you must remember exactly where you saved it, what you named it, or exact words or phrases it contains. I don’t care how good you are, there’s no way someone could remember this much information for thousands of files. And if you can, teach me your secret!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody has presented a solution to this problem. Cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) allow you to access your files from anywhere, which is awesome. But you’re still left with the same primitive tools to find the files you stored on these platforms (navigating through folders and keyword search). But hey, now you can struggle to find your files from anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry, there is finally hope! We’re developing Meta, an application that allows you to access any file in seconds, whether it’s saved on your computer, Dropbox, Google Drive, or in your email inbox. And the best part is you don’t have to remember what you named it or where you saved it!&lt;/p&gt;
