</p>
<p>
    <strong>7. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Services are operated by Rastech Software, Inc. from the United States, and we do not represent or warrant that use of the Services or any component
    thereof is lawful in other jurisdictions. Access to the Service from jurisdictions where such access is illegal is prohibited. All matters arising from or
    relating to this Agreement and the use and operation of the Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
    without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Without derogation of the obligation to arbitrate set forth in <strong><u>Section 8</u></strong> below,
    you agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts. If you gain access to the Services from
    locations outside the United States, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of any such other location, and in no event will you use
    the Services or Content in violation of U.S. export laws or regulations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8. Dispute Resolution</strong>
</p>
<p>
    All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall be resolved exclusively by
    binding arbitration before a single arbitrator (the &quot;Arbitrator&quot;) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
    Association (the &quot;AAA&quot;) then in effect (for information on the AAA and its rules, see www.adr.org.) and the further procedures set forth herein, except
    that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened
    infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. The
    arbitration shall be conducted in Boston, Massachusetts, unless the Arbitrator shall determine that that venue is not reasonably convenient to all parties,
    in which case the Arbitrator shall determine another venue that is. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration,
    and the parties are unable to agree to a substitute, a substitute shall be appointed by the court. The Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any and all
    remedies authorized by law. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 2 et seq. Notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to
    the contrary, any claims shall be adjudicated on an individual basis only, and YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED
    CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES
    THERETO. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to
    this Agreement, unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may
    at your option file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court
    has personal jurisdiction. The provisions of this arbitration section will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. Termination of Service</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You may discontinue your use of the Services at any time. We may terminate your user account or right to access all or portions of the Services at any
    time, without notice, for any reason or for no reason or for conduct that we believe violates this Agreement and/or is harmful to other users, to Rastech
    Software, Inc., to other service or information providers, or to any third parties. After any termination of this Agreement and/or after you otherwise stop
    using the Services, the following will survive and remain enforceable and in full force and effect:
    <strong>
        (i) all outstanding obligations between you and us; (ii) all remedies for breach of this Agreement; and (iii) the following sections of this Agreement:

</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    No delay or omission by Rastech Software, Inc. in exercising any of its rights under this Agreement will impair any such right or be construed to be a
    waiver thereof, and a waiver by Rastech Software, Inc. of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be
    a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained. If any provision of this Agreement is found by
    a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid
    and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
    Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and Rastech Software, Inc. regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior promises,
    agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter. You shall not assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or
    obligation hereunder to any third party. You agree that the electronic text of this Agreement constitutes a writing and your assent to the terms and
    conditions hereof constitutes a &quot;signing&quot; for all purposes.
